connect() process
1. request connection to DB driver
2. TCP/IP connection established
3. ID, PW, etc transmission
4. DB internal: authentication + DB session creation
5. connection established
6. return connection to application

prepare connection pool
- save connection process time
- connection reuse

* summary
- connection pool: tune by performance test
- limit the number of connections to DB
- open source: commons-dbcp2, tomcat-jdbc pool, HikariCP
- recommendation: HikariCP(spring boot default)
